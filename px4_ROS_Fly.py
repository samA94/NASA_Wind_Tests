#Possible changes and improvements:

#All sections need to be tested

#Assuming NED conventions.  However, this is not explicitly stated in documentation

#Yaw is not explained in documentation.  Currently assuming degrees, but might need to be changed
#Also, no explanation of yaw mechanics is given - does it stop and turn, or turn while flying?

#Velocities have similar issues.  Assumed to be global, but they could be local

#Should put the send waypoint and check location into a function for easier access
#Could automate arming, mode set, and takeoff, but would not be as safe or controllable
#Might be useful to have ROS automatically send quad home, but don't currently see a RTL function in mavros
